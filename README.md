### PackIO
During graduate school, I was making electrophysiological recordings and trying to synchronize various pieces of equipment (cameras, lasers, galvanometers, etc.). I found no software that was up to the task so I began a project to develop an uber-system capable of performing any data acquisition or generation operation that could be completed with the National Instruments DAQ hardware in use at the Yuste lab at the time.  I jokingly referred to the project as "PackIO", a combination of my name and IO, as in input/output, as the software is supposed to be able to take any input or generate any output in any synchronized fashion. The name stuck and now PackIO is in use by members of [Rafael Yuste's laboratory](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/faculty/yuste/), [Jason Maclean's laboratory](http://www.macleanlab.com/), and I continue to use PackIO in the [Michael Hausser's laboratory](http://www.dendrites.org/).
